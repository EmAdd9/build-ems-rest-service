# **Architecting a Robust, Hierarchical Employee Management System with Spring Boot**

### **Introduction**

This document outlines the construction of a comprehensive **Employee Management System (EMS)** using the **Spring Boot** framework. The system offers a **RESTful API** for efficient employee data management and is powered by a **MySQL** database for persistent storage. To ensure data integrity and secure access, the EMS utilizes a hierarchical **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** model enforced by **Spring Security**.

---

## **Core Functionalities**

### 1. **RESTful API**
   - **Endpoints**: The system exposes a range of endpoints that follow **REST** principles, making it accessible, interoperable, and scalable.
   - **CRUD Operations**: Supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting employee records.
   - **Response Formats**: Returns **JSON** data for seamless communication with frontend clients.

### 2. **MySQL Integration**
   - Uses **Spring Data JPA** to facilitate smooth interaction with the MySQL database.
   - Provides efficient data persistence and retrieval with **JPA Repositories**.
   - Automated schema management through JPA and MySQL integration.

### 3. **Hierarchical Security with RBAC**
   - Implements a robust **Role-Based Access Control** system using **Spring Security**.
   - Enforces hierarchical access where higher roles inherit permissions from lower ones (e.g., Admin > Manager > Employee).
   - Supports granular role assignments and method-level security annotations.

### 4. **Data Validation**
   - Input data is validated using **Hibernate Validator** (part of the Bean Validation specification).
   - Enforces constraints like `@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Email`, `@Pattern`, ensuring clean and reliable data entry.
   - Custom validation can be added for domain-specific requirements.

### 5. **Error Handling**
   - The system uses **Springâ€™s @ControllerAdvice** for centralized error handling.
   - Provides detailed error messages and returns appropriate **HTTP status codes** (e.g., `400 Bad Request`, `404 Not Found`, `500 Internal Server Error`).
   - Exception-handling mechanisms ensure that errors are gracefully managed and logged for troubleshooting.

## **Technology Stack**

### **Backend**:
- **Spring Boot**: The core of the EMS, offering fast development and embedded servers.
- **Spring Data JPA**: To manage persistence and ORM with MySQL.
- **Spring Security**: To manage authentication and authorization with an RBAC model.

### **Database**:
- **MySQL**: Used for storing employee data and other related entities.

### **Security**:
- **JWT**: For secure, token-based authentication.
- **RBAC**: Hierarchical role-based access control using Spring Security.

### **Testing**:
- **JUnit**: For unit testing the application logic.
- **MockMVC**: For testing the REST endpoints and Spring Security configurations.

## **Architecture Overview**

The EMS system is built using a layered architecture, which promotes separation of concerns and scalability.

1. **Controller Layer**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to appropriate service methods.
2. **Service Layer**: Contains the business logic and orchestrates interaction between repositories and controllers.
3. **Repository Layer**: Manages interaction with the MySQL database via Spring Data JPA.
4. **Security Layer**: Ensures that only authorized users can access protected resources based on their role hierarchy.

## **Installation & Setup**

### **Prerequisites**:
- **Java 17** or higher
- **Maven** for dependency management
- **MySQL** running locally or on a server
- An IDE such as **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Eclipse**

### **Steps**:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/employee-management-system.git
   cd employee-management-system
   ```

2. **Set up MySQL**:
   - Create a MySQL database for the application:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE employee_management;
     ```

3. **Configure application.properties**:
   In `src/main/resources/application.properties`, set your MySQL configurations:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/employee_management
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   - Use **Maven** to package and run the Spring Boot application:
     ```bash
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```

5. **Access the application**:
   - The API is accessible at `http://localhost:8080/api/employees`.

## **Security Architecture**

The security architecture is designed around hierarchical role-based access control:

- **Roles**:
  - `ROLE_ADMIN`: Full access to all resources.
  - `ROLE_MANAGER`: Access to create, view, and modify employee data, but limited admin rights.
  - `ROLE_EMPLOYEE`: Restricted to viewing personal information and submitting update requests.
  
  Each role inherits permissions from the roles below it in the hierarchy.

---

## **Endpoints Overview**

### **Employee Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/employees`: List all employees (Admin, Manager)
- `POST /api/employees`: Add a new employee (Admin)
- `GET /api/employees/{id}`: Get employee by ID (Admin, Manager)
- `PUT /api/employees/{id}`: Update employee data (Admin, Manager)
- `DELETE /api/employees/{id}`: Remove an employee (Admin)
